this is a slack bot build to convert images sent in a channel to code based on the prompt you give it. to give it a prompt you would use a slash command and then you can upload 
the image and it would basically do what you want with that image.
Right now It was built for coding.
to use script just clone repository and send requests or set your endpoint to the root directory 
begginer here  I know the code is not perfect but its a descent start. lol
